# auth_with_bloc

This project is a small part another complete project. and it wont work as expected without the other parts. This just a sample of how to use BloC to handle authentication with Firebase in Flutter. 

You need to configure a router to handle the navigation and a Bloc to handle the authentication.
Also you need to configure the Firebase project and add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project for Ios and `google-services.json` for Android.
For this you can user FlutterFire Cli to configure the project easily.

You can then set up firestore databases if you would like to save user data.
